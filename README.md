Backend CRUD without a line of code

More info @ [Laravel Forums](http://forums.laravel.io/viewtopic.php?id=15689)

### Installation

This shipping includes an app that I use for rapid development. You can set it up and see what Cruddy is capable of.

At first you need to clone this repo. It has a submodule that you need to update, so 
run following commands:

```
git submodule init && git submodule update && composer install
```

Then, configure database credentials as you would do in usual Laravel app. Migrate and seed database:

```
php artisan migrate --package cartalyst/sentry && php artisan migrate --seed
```

You can now enter the backend by entering `<hostname>/backend/users`. It will require username and password. The defaults:

admin@mail.com / admin

Enjoy!
